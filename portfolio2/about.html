        Hi, I'm Naina Agrawal — a passionate and curious Computer Science graduate from Vellore Institute of Technology,
        having
        specialized in Information Security. With a GPA of 9.09/10, I bring not just academic excellence but a proactive
        approach to learning and solving real-world problems.Currently, I’m interning at Prodapt Solutions, where I
        contribute to building
        scalable and efficient software solutions that drive innovation in the telecom domain. My previous experience as
        a Java Developer
        Intern at LTIMindtree involved creating powerful automation tools for Excel data processing, resulting in
        improved efficiency and
        accuracy across teams. I love working on projects that combine data intelligence, secure systems, and smart
        automation—whether it’s
        forecasting stock trends, detecting crop diseases with deep learning, or analyzing air quality using machine
        learning. As a former
        Technical Head at IEEE ITS and a student coordinator for national-level conferences, I also value collaboration,
        leadership, and
        clear communication. I’m always excited to take on new challenges, explore cross-functional roles, and grow as a
        security-focused
        engineer ready to create real impact.
